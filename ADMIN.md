## H5P

Displaying the list of H5Ps activities based on criteria:

After logging in to the Admin Panel, navigate to the "Courses" tab in the left sidebar menu and select "H5Ps" from the dropdown list. Here, you will find interactive H5P exercises. These exercises are designed to assess learners' knowledge through various puzzling activities based on the learned course content or as visual enhancements to the course materials.

Above the area for the list of potential H5P quizzes, you can see three options: "New H5P File: Add File," and once again, filtering options: "Title" and "Library ID."

**New H5P File:** Add File - By using the "Click here to add" button, you can add an H5P element to the Admin Panel if you have downloaded it, for example, from the website https://h5p.org/. Remember! You can download and add the H5P file in the *h5p format.

This is how the file will look after downloading it to your computer. The file is in H5P format, and you can transfer it using Import and Export functions.

Returning to filtering:

**Title** - used for filtering specific exercise items. For example, if we added a multiple-choice test and named it "Exam on Country Flags", searching for the phrase "Exam" or "country flags" in this field will display that specific item on the list.

**Library ID** - allows you to search for specific types of exercises (e.g., Drag and Drop) by their assigned IDs in the system. Below are the IDs that will facilitate the search for the desired H5P elements in:

* Accordion - ID: 1
* Agamotto - ID: 2
* Arithmetic Quiz - ID: 4
* Audio Recorder - ID: 5
* Collage - ID: 6

As usual, to apply the filters we have set, press the blue "Query" button. The white "Reset" button clears the visible filters. ![image](https://github.com/EscolaLMS/H5P/assets/108077902/0ba0fc63-aac5-4fea-ada5-56e26e99677a)

Sorting in the library allows for quick organization of libraries in any desired order:

* ID - Sequential number for the created H5P interactive exercise.
* Title - Title of the exercise created in the H5P editor.
* Library - Name of the utilized exercise type.
* Library ID - Sequential number for the exercise type library.
* H5P count - Number of exercises in a single editor.
* Options - Manual settings for the library.



The "+New" button allows you to add a new H5P activity, while the options below allow you to: edit, delete, preview, and download the H5P package as an export. You can find all types of H5P content at https://h5p.org/content-types-and-app. Below are descriptions of exercises that can be created directly on the platform using the H5P editor.

If the delete button is grayed out, it means that the exercise is being used in a course, and you cannot delete it directly from the library. This is a safeguard to prevent accidental deletion. You need to remove the exercise from the course first before you can delete it from the library.

When creating a new exercise on the platform, we use the H5P template editor. By clicking "+New," the exercise selection editor opens, where we choose the desired template to fill in. Finally, we click the "submit data" button to save our exercise and add it to the library.

As a reminder, we can add or create H5P directly within the course being created. We use the H5P Topic to import an exercise or create one from a template.

Certainly, you can also add an H5P file to the topic being created using interactive exercises. The option to add it can be found at the bottom of the page.
