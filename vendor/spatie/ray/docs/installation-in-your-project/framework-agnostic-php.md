To start using Ray in any PHP project, install the `ray` package.

```bash
composer require spatie/ray
```

You should be able to use the `ray` function without any other steps.

If you use Laravel, you should use install [the Laravel specific package](/docs/ray/v1/installation-in-your-project/laravel) instead of `spatie/ray`.
