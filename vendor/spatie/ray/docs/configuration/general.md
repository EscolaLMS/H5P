In PHP based projects, you can optionally configure Ray by creating a file named `ray.php` in your project directory.  We recommend putting `ray.php` in your `.gitignore` so your fellow developers can use their own configuration.

Ray will also look for `ray.php` in all parent directories of your project. To configure multiple Ray for multiple projects in one go, you could create a `ray.php` file in the directory where all your projects reside in.
