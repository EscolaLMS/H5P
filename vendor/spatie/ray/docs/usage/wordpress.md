In WordPress, you can use all methods from [the framework agnostic version](/docs/ray/v1/usage/framework-agnostic-php-project).

Additionally, you can use these following WordPress specific methods.

## Showing queries

You can display all queries that are executed by calling `showQueries` (or `queries`).

```php
ray()->showQueries();

// somewhere else in your WordPress app
global $wpdb;
$result = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM wp_usermeta WHERE meta_key = 'points' AND user_id = '1'");
```

To stop showing queries, call `stopShowingQueries()`

### Displaying mails

To show all mails sent in Ray call `showMails()`.

```php
ray()->showMails();

// somewhere else in your WordPress app
wp_mail('to@email.com', 'my subject', 'the content');
```

To stop showing mail, call `stopShowingMails()`.

### Production environments

By default, Ray is disabled in production environments. If you want to use Ray in a production environment, you must explicitly enable it with `ray()->enable()`.

For more information about using the `enable()` function, see the [framework agnostic docs](/docs/ray/v1/usage/framework-agnostic-php-project).
