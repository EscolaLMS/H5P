To use Ray with Homestead you should use the config file mentioned in [the Laravel configuration instructions](/docs/ray/v1/configuration/laravel). When using Homestead with the VirtualBox provider, you should use `10.0.2.2` as the IP for the host; and when you're using Homestead with the Parallels provider, you should use `10.211.55.2` as the IP for the host.
